## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Full-Stack Onion Architecture
**4 Layers Implemented**:
1. **Domain** (Core Business Logic)
   - Entities: User, Analytics, Achievement
   - Interfaces: IAuthService, IAnalyticsService, IMicroserviceClient
   - Types: JSDoc type definitions

2. **Application** (Use Cases)
   - Use Cases: CalculateAnalytics, AuthenticateUser, RefreshAnalytics
   - Services: AnalyticsService, AuthService, AuthorizationService
   - Interfaces: Application service contracts

3. **Infrastructure** (External Dependencies)
   - Database: PrismaClient
   - External: 9 microservice clients
   - Cache: RailwayCacheClient (in-memory Map)
   - Queue: PgBossClient

4. **Presentation** (API Layer)
   - Routes: Express route definitions
   - Controllers: AnalyticsController, AuthController
   - Middleware: Authentication, authorization, validation

### Multi-Role System
**Implementation**:
- ✅ Role-based API endpoints (`/learner/`, `/trainer/`, `/org-admin/`)
- ✅ X-Active-Role header validation
- ✅ RBAC at backend layer (middleware + service layer)
- ✅ Data access controls (users can only access own data)

### Security Architecture
**3-Layer Security**:
1. **Frontend Layer**: AuthGuard, protected routes
2. **Backend Layer**: JWT middleware, RBAC validation
3. **Database Layer**: RLS policies, K-anonymity

### Performance Architecture
**3-Layer Caching**:
1. **Railway In-Memory Cache**: 24-hour TTL
2. **Database Cache**: 7-day retention
3. **Aggregated Cache**: 7-year retention, partitioned

**Batch Processing**:
- Daily batch at 02:00 UTC
- Manual refresh (rate-limited)
- Circuit breaker for external services
