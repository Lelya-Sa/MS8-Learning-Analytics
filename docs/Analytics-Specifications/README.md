## 🎯 Key Corrections Made

### **1. Learning Paths Clarification** ✅

**Old Understanding (WRONG):**
- "Learning Paths Enrollment" - enrollment list

**Corrected Understanding:**
- "Desired Learning Topics" - list of topics learner WANTS to learn
- It's a wishlist/goal list, NOT an enrollment
- Actual structured learning path comes from Learner AI MS

**Updated in:** `03-Data-Schemas/Layer1-Raw-Data-Schema.md`

## 📚 Cohort Explanation

### **What is a Cohort?**

A **cohort** is a group of learners who share common characteristics and can be tracked/compared as a group.

**Types of Cohorts:**

1. **Time-Based Cohort**
   - Example: "January 2025 React Cohort"
   - All learners who started React course in January 2025
   - Used for comparing completion rates across batches

2. **Department Cohort**
   - Example: "Engineering Team Q1 Upskilling"
   - All engineers taking specific courses in Q1
   - Used for department-level progress tracking

3. **Skill Level Cohort**
   - Example: "Beginner Python Learners"
   - All learners starting Python with no prior experience
   - Used for comparing similar skill levels

4. **Learning Path Cohort**
   - Example: "Full Stack Developer Program - Cohort 5"
   - 5th group going through the full stack curriculum
   - Used for program effectiveness and graduation rates

**Why Cohorts Matter:**
- ✅ Compare "Your cohort vs previous cohorts"
- ✅ Identify which cohorts perform better (improve curriculum)
- ✅ Predict outcomes based on cohort patterns
- ✅ Provide context: "You're in top 20% of your cohort"
- ✅ Track at-risk cohort members for intervention
