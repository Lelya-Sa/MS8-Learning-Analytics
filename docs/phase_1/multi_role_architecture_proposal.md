# Multi-Role Architecture Decision - Proposal for Mediated Debate

**Phase**: 1B - Scope Definition  
**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: üìã PROPOSAL (Awaiting User Confirmation)  
**Decision Method**: 15-Round Mediated Debate  
**Roles**: TL, PM, SA, SE, FE, BE, DD, DA

---

## üìã Context

The user has clarified that MS8 Learning Analytics must support **multi-role users**:
- A single user can have multiple roles (e.g., learner + trainer + org_admin)
- Each role has **separate dashboards** (no merged data)
- Users can **switch between roles** in the UI
- **RBAC enforcement** at all layers
- **Privacy rules** (K-anonymity for comparisons)

**User's Request**: 
> "You should decide with the multirole mentioned in init_prompt we are using as the main prompt on which kind of architecture should we use, I will confirm/reject."

## üéØ Architectural Decisions Required

We need to decide on **5 critical architectural aspects** for the multi-role system:

### **1. Multi-Role Data Storage Strategy**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Single `analytics` table with `user_id`, `role`, `analytics_type` columns
- **Option B**: Separate tables per role (`learner_analytics`, `trainer_analytics`, `org_admin_analytics`)
- **Option C**: Hybrid (shared base table + role-specific extension tables)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Option A**: Simpler queries, easier to add roles, but complex indexes
- **Option B**: Cleaner separation, optimized per role, but harder to add roles
- **Option C**: Flexible, but more complex schema

---

### **2. Multi-Role Session Management**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Single JWT with `roles: ["learner", "trainer"]` array, frontend tracks active role
- **Option B**: Separate JWT per role (user gets multiple tokens on login)
- **Option C**: Single JWT + "active role" claim that changes on role switch

**Trade-offs**:
- **Option A**: Simple, stateless, but frontend must track active role
- **Option B**: Cleaner separation, but complex token management
- **Option C**: Requires token refresh on role switch (not truly stateless)

---

### **3. Multi-Role UI Architecture**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Role switcher dropdown in header ‚Üí reloads dashboard for new role
- **Option B**: Separate login per role (user logs in as "learner" OR "trainer")
- **Option C**: Unified dashboard with role-based tabs/sections

**Trade-offs**:
- **Option A**: Best UX, flexible, aligns with user requirement
- **Option B**: Simplest backend, but poor UX (multiple logins)
- **Option C**: Complex UI, violates "separate dashboards" requirement

---

### **4. Multi-Role Analytics Calculation**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Calculate analytics per `(user_id, role)` pair independently
- **Option B**: Calculate once per user, filter by role on retrieval
- **Option C**: Calculate per user, store per role with denormalization

**Trade-offs**:
- **Option A**: Clean separation, no cross-role leakage, but more computation
- **Option B**: Efficient, but risk of cross-role data leakage
- **Option C**: Fast retrieval, but storage overhead

---

### **5. Multi-Role RBAC Enforcement**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Middleware checks JWT roles + active role from request header
- **Option B**: Database RLS policies check `user_id` + `role` columns
- **Option C**: Both (middleware + RLS for defense-in-depth)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Option A**: Flexible, fast, but no DB-level protection
- **Option B**: Secure at DB level, but harder to debug
- **Option C**: Most secure, but more complex setup

## ü§î Proposed Mediated Debate Structure

**Debate Topic**: "Multi-Role Architecture for MS8 Learning Analytics"

**Participants** (from Init_Prompt roles):
- **TL** (Tech Lead): Overall technical direction
- **PM** (Product Manager): User experience and business requirements
- **SA** (System Architect): System design and patterns
- **SE** (Security Engineer): Security and access control
- **FE** (Frontend Engineer): UI/UX implementation
- **BE** (Backend Engineer): API and business logic
- **DD** (Database Designer): Data model and queries
- **DA** (Data Analyst): Analytics calculation and performance

**Debate Format**:
- **15 rounds** until consensus
- Each role presents their perspective
- Roles debate trade-offs
- Final consensus recommendation

**Debate Sections**:
1. **Round 1-3**: Each role presents initial position on all 5 decisions
2. **Round 4-6**: Debate data storage strategy (Decision #1)
3. **Round 7-9**: Debate session management (Decision #2)
4. **Round 10-12**: Debate UI architecture (Decision #3)
5. **Round 13-14**: Debate analytics calculation + RBAC (Decisions #4-5)
6. **Round 15**: Final consensus and recommendation

---

## üìä Preliminary Recommendation (Before Debate)

Based on the user's requirements and Init_Prompt principles, here's a **preliminary recommendation** (subject to debate):

### **Recommended Architecture**:

**1. Data Storage**: **Option A** (Single table with `user_id`, `role`, `analytics_type`)
- **Rationale**: Easier to add roles, simpler schema, aligns with Phase 1A debate results

**2. Session Management**: **Option A** (Single JWT with roles array, frontend tracks active role)
- **Rationale**: Stateless, simple, aligns with JWT best practices

**3. UI Architecture**: **Option A** (Role switcher dropdown ‚Üí reload dashboard)
- **Rationale**: Best UX, aligns with user requirement for "separate dashboards per role"

**4. Analytics Calculation**: **Option A** (Calculate per `(user_id, role)` pair)
- **Rationale**: Clean separation, no cross-role leakage, aligns with privacy requirements

**5. RBAC Enforcement**: **Option C** (Both middleware + RLS)
- **Rationale**: Defense-in-depth, aligns with security-first principle from Init_Prompt

## üéØ Expected Outcome

After the 15-round debate, we will have:
1. ‚úÖ **Consensus on all 5 architectural decisions**
2. ‚úÖ **Detailed implementation plan** for multi-role system
3. ‚úÖ **Trade-off analysis** documented
4. ‚úÖ **User confirmation** (confirm/reject)

## ‚ùì Question for User

**Should I proceed with the 15-round mediated debate now?**

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Yes, run the full debate now (will take ~15-20 minutes to generate)
- **Option B**: Skip debate, use preliminary recommendation (faster, but less thorough)
- **Option C**: Debate only specific decisions (which ones?)

**Your decision**: ?
