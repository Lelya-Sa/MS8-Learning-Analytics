## 📋 Context

**Question**: What state management approach should MS8 use for the Learning Analytics dashboard?

**Options**:
1. **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)** - Server state management with built-in caching
2. **Redux + Redux Toolkit** - Global state container with predictable state updates
3. **Zustand** - Lightweight global state with minimal boilerplate
4. **React Context API** - Built-in React state management
5. **Hybrid (SWR + Context)** - SWR for server state, Context for UI state

**Technical Context**:
- Vite + React frontend
- Multiple dashboards (Learner, Trainer, Org Admin)
- Role switching capability
- Real-time analytics updates
- Mock data fallback strategy
- Progressive loading (fast initial paint)

---

## 🎯 Round 1: Initial Positions

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
I recommend **Option 5: Hybrid (SWR + Context)**. Here's why:
- SWR excels at server state (analytics data, user profiles)
- Context API perfect for UI state (role switching, theme, preferences)
- Separation of concerns: don't mix server and UI state
- SWR's built-in caching aligns with our < 2.5s load requirement
- Minimal dependencies (SWR + built-in Context)

**Concerns**: Need to ensure team understands when to use SWR vs Context.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
I lean toward **Option 3: Zustand**. Reasons:
- Simpler than Redux, more powerful than Context
- Single source of truth for all state
- Easy to debug with Redux DevTools
- No provider hell like Context
- Tiny bundle size (1KB)

**Concerns**: How do we handle server state caching? Would need to build caching layer ourselves.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
I prefer **Option 1: Pure SWR**. Architecture perspective:
- MS8 is data-heavy (19 analytics, dashboards, reports)
- 90% of state is server state (analytics data)
- SWR's automatic revalidation fits our "fresh data" requirement
- Built-in error handling and retry logic
- Optimistic UI updates

**Concerns**: UI state (role selection, filters) might feel awkward in SWR.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
I support **Option 5: Hybrid (SWR + Context)**. Performance rationale:
- SWR's dedupe + cache = fewer API calls
- Automatic background revalidation = fresh data without blocking UI
- Context for lightweight UI state avoids prop drilling
- SWR's suspense integration = better loading states

**Concerns**: Need to ensure Context doesn't cause unnecessary re-renders.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
From requirements perspective, **Option 5: Hybrid** makes sense:
- Requirement: "Dashboard loads < 2.5s" → SWR caching ✓
- Requirement: "Role switching in header" → Context for current role ✓
- Requirement: "Fresh data on demand" → SWR revalidation ✓
- Requirement: "Mock data fallback" → SWR's fallbackData ✓

**Concerns**: Need clear guidelines on what goes in SWR vs Context.

---

## 🎯 Round 2: Addressing Concerns

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Addressing FE's concern about Zustand:
- Zustand doesn't have built-in server state management
- We'd need to implement: caching, revalidation, deduplication, error handling
- SWR gives us all of this for free
- Team learning curve: SWR is simpler than Redux, more focused than Zustand for our use case

Counter to SA: UI state in SWR feels awkward because SWR is designed for server state. That's why hybrid is better.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
I'm warming to the Hybrid approach. Question:
- What goes in SWR? (analytics data, user profiles, reports)
- What goes in Context? (current role, UI preferences, filter state, theme)

If we have clear boundaries, Hybrid could work well. But I'm concerned about:
- Managing two state systems
- When a Context change triggers SWR refetch (e.g., role change)

### **SA (Software Architect)**
FE raises a good point. Let me propose clear boundaries:

**SWR (Server State)**:
- Analytics data (all 19 categories)
- User profiles
- Organization data
- Reports
- External microservice data

**Context (UI State)**:
- Current active role
- Dashboard preferences (expanded/collapsed panels)
- Filter selections (before applying)
- Theme/accessibility settings
- Notification toasts

**Integration**: When role changes in Context, SWR hooks automatically refetch with new role parameter.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
To address FE's concern about Context re-renders:
- Use multiple small contexts (RoleContext, ThemeContext, PreferencesContext)
- Avoid single monolithic context
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for context values
- Only components that need role info subscribe to RoleContext

This keeps re-renders minimal and performant.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
From requirements perspective, I need clarity on:
- How does mock data fallback work in this model?
- How do we handle "fresh data" button (requirement: async job polling)?
- How do we persist preferences across sessions?

---

## 🎯 Round 3: Technical Deep Dive

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Let me answer RE's questions with Hybrid approach:

**Mock Data Fallback**:
```javascript
// SWR with fallback
const { data, error } = useSWR(
  `/api/v1/analytics/learner/${userId}`,
  fetcher,
  {
    fallbackData: MOCK_LEARNER_DATA, // if API fails
    revalidateOnMount: true
  }
);
```

**Fresh Data (Async Job)**:
```javascript
// Trigger job, poll status
const { data: jobStatus } = useSWR(
  jobId ? `/api/v1/data-collection/${jobId}/status` : null,
  fetcher,
  { refreshInterval: 3000 } // poll every 3s
);
```

**Persist Preferences**:
```javascript
// Context + localStorage
const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState(() => {
  return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userPreferences')) || defaults;
});
```

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
I'm now convinced. Hybrid approach with clear boundaries makes sense. Here's my understanding:

**File Structure**:
```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useLearnerAnalytics.js  // SWR hook
│   ├── useTrainerAnalytics.js  // SWR hook
│   └── useRole.js              // Context hook
├── contexts/
│   ├── RoleContext.jsx
│   ├── ThemeContext.jsx
│   └── PreferencesContext.jsx
└── services/
    └── analyticsService.js     // API fetchers for SWR
```

**Question**: Do we need a global SWR config?

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Yes, FE. Global SWR config for consistency:

```javascript
// App.jsx
<SWRConfig value={{
  fetcher: (url) => fetch(url).then(r => r.json()),
  revalidateOnFocus: false,
  dedupingInterval: 5000,
  errorRetryCount: 3,
  errorRetryInterval: 2000,
  onError: (error) => {
    // Global error handling
    console.error('SWR Error:', error);
  }
}}>
  <App />
</SWRConfig>
```

This ensures all SWR hooks behave consistently across dashboards.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
From performance perspective, this Hybrid approach gives us:
- **< 100ms** for cached data (SWR)
- **< 500ms** for fresh data (API)
- **0ms** for UI state changes (Context)
- **Automatic deduplication** (multiple components requesting same data)

Meets all our performance requirements. ✓

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
I'm satisfied. This approach covers:
- ✓ Fast dashboard loads (SWR cache)
- ✓ Role switching (Context)
- ✓ Fresh data on demand (SWR revalidation)
- ✓ Mock data fallback (SWR fallbackData)
- ✓ Real-time updates (SWR refreshInterval)
- ✓ Offline resilience (SWR cache)

---

## 🎯 Round 4: Edge Cases & Error Handling

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Let's discuss edge cases:

**Edge Case 1**: User switches roles while analytics are loading.
- Solution: SWR automatically cancels in-flight requests and starts new ones

**Edge Case 2**: API returns partial data (some microservices down).
- Solution: Backend returns partial data + `warnings` array, UI shows warnings banner

**Edge Case 3**: User has no data yet (new user).
- Solution: SWR returns empty data, UI shows onboarding state

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Adding to edge cases:

**Edge Case 4**: Network goes offline mid-session.
- Solution: SWR serves stale data, shows "offline" indicator, retries when back online

**Edge Case 5**: Token expires during session.
- Solution: Global SWR error handler detects 401, redirects to login

Implementation:
```javascript
onError: (error, key) => {
  if (error.status === 401) {
    // Token expired
    router.push('/login');
  } else if (error.status === 403) {
    // Insufficient permissions
    showToast('You don\'t have permission to view this data');
  }
}
```

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Security consideration:
- Context stores current role (from JWT)
- SWR automatically includes role in API requests
- Backend validates role permissions (RBAC)

**Question**: Should we validate role client-side before fetching?

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
To SA: Yes, client-side validation prevents unnecessary API calls.

```javascript
const { data } = useLearnerAnalytics(userId, {
  enabled: currentRole === 'learner' // Don't fetch if wrong role
});
```

This saves bandwidth and reduces backend load.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Requirement check: "Multi-role users can switch roles".
- Does role switch trigger full dashboard re-render?
- Or just refetch data?

---

## 🎯 Round 5: Performance Optimization

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
To RE: Role switch should be optimized:

```javascript
// RoleContext.jsx
const RoleProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [currentRole, setCurrentRole] = useState(getInitialRole());
  
  const switchRole = useCallback((newRole) => {
    setCurrentRole(newRole);
    // Clear SWR cache for old role
    mutate(() => true, undefined, { revalidate: false });
    // Prefetch data for new role
    prefetchDashboard(newRole);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <RoleContext.Provider value={{ currentRole, switchRole }}>
      {children}
    </RoleContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

Result: Role switch feels instant, data loads in background.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Smart! Additional optimization: Prefetch on hover.

```javascript
<RoleDropdown
  onMouseEnter={() => {
    // Prefetch data for all user's roles
    userRoles.forEach(role => prefetchDashboard(role));
  }}
/>
```

User hovers dropdown → data preloads → switch is instant.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Architecture blessing: This maintains clean separation.
- RoleContext = UI concern (what role is active)
- SWR = Data concern (fetch data for active role)
- No coupling between them

Scalability: Adding new roles just means adding new dashboard components.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance metrics we can achieve:
- **Role switch**: < 100ms (cached data)
- **First dashboard load**: < 2.5s (requirement met)
- **Subsequent loads**: < 100ms (SWR cache)
- **Background refresh**: 0ms blocking time

All requirements exceeded. ✓

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Final requirement check:
- ✓ Fast loads
- ✓ Role switching
- ✓ Fresh data
- ✓ Mock fallback
- ✓ Real-time updates
- ✓ Progressive loading
- ✓ Error handling
- ✓ Offline resilience

All requirements satisfied with Hybrid approach.

---

## 🎯 Round 6: Developer Experience

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Let's ensure good DX (Developer Experience):

**Simple API for devs**:
```javascript
// Using analytics data
const { data, error, isLoading, mutate } = useLearnerAnalytics(userId);

// Using role
const { currentRole, switchRole } = useRole();

// Trigger fresh data
const refreshData = () => mutate();
```

Clean, intuitive, minimal boilerplate.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
DX wins with Hybrid:
- ✓ No Redux boilerplate (actions, reducers, sagas)
- ✓ No prop drilling (Context provides role)
- ✓ Automatic caching (SWR handles it)
- ✓ Type safety with JSDoc
- ✓ Easy testing (mock SWR responses)

Example test:
```javascript
import { SWRConfig } from 'swr';

test('LearnerDashboard renders analytics', () => {
  render(
    <SWRConfig value={{ provider: () => new Map() }}>
      <LearnerDashboard userId="123" />
    </SWRConfig>
  );
  // assertions
});
```

### **SA (Software Architect)**
From architecture perspective, this is maintainable:
- Clear file structure (hooks/, contexts/, services/)
- Single responsibility (each hook does one thing)
- Easy to add new analytics (just add new hook)
- Easy to add new UI state (just add new context)

Future-proof: If we need global state later, we can add Zustand without refactoring SWR.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
DX meets performance:
- Devs write simple code
- SWR optimizes automatically
- No manual cache management
- No race conditions (SWR handles)

Win-win.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
From requirements perspective:
- Developers can deliver features faster (less boilerplate)
- Code is easier to review (simpler patterns)
- Bugs are easier to fix (fewer moving parts)

Aligns with quality standards requirement.

## 🎯 Round 7: Testing Strategy

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Testing strategy for Hybrid approach:

**Unit Tests** (SWR hooks):
```javascript
test('useLearnerAnalytics fetches and caches data', async () => {
  const { result, waitForNextUpdate } = renderHook(
    () => useLearnerAnalytics('user123'),
    { wrapper: SWRConfigProvider }
  );
  
  expect(result.current.isLoading).toBe(true);
  await waitForNextUpdate();
  expect(result.current.data).toEqual(mockData);
});
```

**Integration Tests** (Context + SWR):
```javascript
test('role switch triggers data refetch', async () => {
  const { getByText, findByText } = render(<Dashboard />);
  
  fireEvent.click(getByText('Switch to Trainer'));
  expect(await findByText('Trainer Analytics')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Adding component tests:

```javascript
test('dashboard shows mock data when API fails', async () => {
  server.use(
    rest.get('/api/v1/analytics/*', (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.status(500));
    })
  );
  
  render(<LearnerDashboard />);
  
  // Should show mock data as fallback
  expect(await screen.findByText('Mock Learning Velocity')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Ensures fallback strategy works.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Testing architecture decisions:
- SWR hooks are pure functions (easy to test)
- Context providers are isolated (easy to mock)
- No complex state machines (no Redux sagas to test)

Test coverage requirement (85%+) is achievable.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance testing:
```javascript
test('dashboard loads in < 2.5s', async () => {
  const startTime = performance.now();
  
  render(<LearnerDashboard />);
  
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Learning Velocity')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(2500);
});
```

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Test coverage for requirements:
- ✓ Fast loads (performance test)
- ✓ Role switching (integration test)
- ✓ Mock fallback (error handling test)
- ✓ Fresh data (revalidation test)

All requirements testable.

---

## 🎯 Round 8: Security Considerations

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Security with Hybrid approach:

**1. Token Management**:
```javascript
// SWR global config
const fetcher = async (url) => {
  const token = getTokenFromStorage();
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(response.statusText);
  return response.json();
};
```

**2. Role-Based Rendering**:
```javascript
const { currentRole } = useRole();

return (
  <>
    {currentRole === 'learner' && <LearnerDashboard />}
    {currentRole === 'trainer' && <TrainerDashboard />}
  </>
);
```

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Security concerns:
- JWT stored in httpOnly cookie (not localStorage)
- Role validated on backend (not trusted from Context)
- SWR automatically includes credentials

**Question**: What if user tampers with role in Context?

### **SA (Software Architect)**
To FE: Client-side role is for UI only. Backend validates:

```javascript
// Backend validates on every request
app.get('/api/v1/analytics/learner/:userId', 
  validateJWT,
  checkRole(['learner', 'trainer']),
  async (req, res) => {
    // req.user.role already validated
    // req.user.userId already validated
  }
);
```

Client-side role just determines which UI to show. Backend is source of truth.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Security doesn't hurt performance:
- JWT validation is fast (< 5ms)
- Role check is in-memory (< 1ms)
- No performance trade-off

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Security requirement: "JWT + RBAC". ✓
- JWT from MS12 (authentication)
- RBAC on backend (authorization)
- Context for UX (doesn't affect security)

Requirement met.

---

## 🎯 Round 9: Scalability

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Scalability with Hybrid:

**Adding new analytics**:
```javascript
// Just add new hook
export const useNewAnalytic = (userId) => {
  return useSWR(`/api/v1/analytics/new/${userId}`, fetcher);
};
```

**Adding new role**:
```javascript
// Just add to RoleContext and add new dashboard
const VALID_ROLES = ['learner', 'trainer', 'org_admin', 'new_role'];
```

No architectural changes needed.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Code organization scales:
```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── analytics/
│   │   ├── useLearnerAnalytics.js
│   │   ├── useTrainerAnalytics.js
│   │   ├── useOrgAnalytics.js
│   │   └── ... (add more)
│   └── contexts/
│       ├── useRole.js
│       ├── useTheme.js
│       └── ... (add more)
```

Clear separation, easy to scale.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Architecture scalability:
- SWR handles 100s of concurrent requests (deduplication)
- Context handles any number of consumers
- No state size limits (unlike Redux)

If we hit scale issues later:
- Add Redis for backend cache
- Add CDN for static data
- Add service worker for offline

But for 10,000+ users, current approach is sufficient.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance scales:
- SWR cache is in-memory (fast, unlimited size)
- Context updates are O(n) where n = consumers
- For 10,000 users, 99% see cached data (< 100ms)

Scales to requirement.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Requirements scalability:
- Current: 19 analytics
- Future: 50+ analytics?

Hybrid approach scales linearly (add more hooks). No bottleneck.

---

## 🎯 Round 10: Migration & Compatibility

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Migration concerns:

**Existing code**:
- Some components might already use `fetch` directly
- Some might use custom hooks

**Migration strategy**:
1. Add SWR + Context alongside existing code
2. Migrate dashboard by dashboard
3. Remove old code once migrated

No big-bang rewrite needed.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Backwards compatibility:
```javascript
// Old code still works
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/analytics/learner/123')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(setData);
}, []);

// New code uses SWR
const { data } = useLearnerAnalytics('123');
```

Gradual migration path.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
From architecture perspective:
- Hybrid approach doesn't break existing patterns
- Can coexist with any existing state management
- No vendor lock-in (SWR is just a library)

If we decide to change later:
- SWR hooks are just wrappers around fetch
- Easy to swap out

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance during migration:
- Old code: no caching, slow
- New code: cached, fast

Incremental performance wins as we migrate.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
No new requirements during migration. Existing features keep working.

## 🎯 Round 11: Documentation & Learning Curve

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Documentation plan:

**1. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**:
```markdown
# ADR-001: Frontend State Management

## Decision
Use Hybrid approach: SWR for server state, Context for UI state.

## Rationale
- SWR excels at server state (caching, revalidation, deduplication)
- Context excels at UI state (role, theme, preferences)
- Clear separation of concerns

## Consequences
- Developers need to learn SWR (2-3 hours)
- Two state systems to understand
- Better performance and maintainability
```

**2. Developer Guide**:
- When to use SWR vs Context
- How to create new analytics hooks
- How to test with SWR

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Learning curve:

**SWR** (Easy):
- Basic usage: 30 minutes
- Advanced features: 2-3 hours
- Official docs are excellent

**Context API** (Very Easy):
- Already part of React
- Team likely already knows it

**Total**: 1 day for team to be productive.

Compared to Redux: 3-5 days. We save 4 days of learning time.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Knowledge transfer:
- Existing SWR examples in docs
- Existing Context examples everywhere
- No custom abstractions to explain

New developers onboard faster.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance documentation:
- Why SWR is fast (caching, deduplication)
- How to optimize Context (split contexts, memoization)
- Performance benchmarks

Clear guidelines prevent performance issues.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Documentation requirement: "JSDoc for all functions". ✓

```javascript
/**
 * Fetches learner analytics data with automatic caching and revalidation.
 * @param {string} userId - The learner's user ID
 * @param {Object} options - SWR options
 * @returns {Object} { data, error, isLoading, mutate }
 */
export const useLearnerAnalytics = (userId, options = {}) => {
  return useSWR(`/api/v1/analytics/learner/${userId}`, fetcher, options);
};
```

---

## 🎯 Round 12: Debugging & Observability

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Debugging strategy:

**1. SWR DevTools**:
```javascript
// In development
import { SWRDevTools } from '@swr-devtools/react';

<SWRConfig>
  <SWRDevTools />
  <App />
</SWRConfig>
```

Shows all SWR cache, requests, errors.

**2. React DevTools**:
- Inspect Context values
- See component re-renders

**3. Correlation IDs**:
```javascript
const fetcher = async (url) => {
  const correlationId = generateCorrelationId();
  const response = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      'X-Correlation-ID': correlationId
    }
  });
  console.log(`[${correlationId}] ${url}`, response);
  return response.json();
};
```

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Error tracking:
```javascript
// Global error handler in SWRConfig
onError: (error, key) => {
  // Send to error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    tags: {
      swrKey: key,
      userRole: getCurrentRole()
    }
  });
}
```

All SWR errors automatically tracked.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Observability architecture:
- Frontend: SWR cache state, error tracking
- Backend: Correlation IDs, structured logging
- Integration: Correlation IDs link frontend → backend

Easy to debug issues across stack.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Performance monitoring:
```javascript
// Measure SWR cache performance
const { data, isLoading } = useSWR(key, fetcher, {
  onSuccess: (data, key) => {
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    analytics.track('SWR_LOAD_TIME', { key, loadTime });
  }
});
```

Track real-world performance metrics.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Requirement: "Logging & Observability (correlation IDs)". ✓

Hybrid approach supports this fully.

---

## 🎯 Round 13: Cost & Maintenance

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Cost analysis:

**Dependencies**:
- SWR: ~5KB gzipped (free, open source)
- Context: 0KB (built into React)
- **Total**: ~5KB

**Maintenance**:
- SWR: Stable, v2.x, active development
- Context: Part of React core
- Low maintenance burden

**Comparison**:
- Redux: ~15KB + middleware
- MobX: ~20KB
- Zustand: ~1KB (but need to build caching)

Hybrid is cost-effective.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
Developer time cost:
- Implementing: 1-2 days (setup + docs)
- Learning: 1 day (team training)
- Maintaining: Minimal (stable APIs)

**ROI**: Faster feature development (less boilerplate) pays back initial investment in 2 weeks.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
Technical debt:
- Low: Simple patterns, well-documented
- Refactoring: Easy to change later if needed
- Vendor lock-in: Minimal (SWR is just a wrapper)

Low long-term risk.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
Infrastructure cost:
- SWR reduces API calls (caching, deduplication)
- Fewer backend requests = lower hosting costs
- Estimated savings: 30-40% fewer API requests

Pays for itself.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Budget requirement: "$0 for additional state management libraries". ✓
- SWR: Free
- Context: Free
- Total cost: $0

Requirement met.

---

## 🎯 Round 14: Alternative Scenarios

### **TL (Tech Lead)**
Let's challenge our decision. What if:

**Scenario 1**: Project grows to 100+ components?
- Hybrid scales fine (proven in large apps)
- If issues arise, add Zustand for complex UI state

**Scenario 2**: Need offline-first capability?
- SWR has built-in cache persistence plugins
- Add service worker for full offline support

**Scenario 3**: Team prefers Redux?
- Can use Redux for UI state instead of Context
- Still use SWR for server state

Hybrid is flexible.

### **FE (Frontend Engineer)**
What if we chose **Redux instead**?
- ❌ More boilerplate (actions, reducers)
- ❌ Larger bundle (~15KB vs 5KB)
- ❌ Still need caching layer for server state
- ❌ Longer learning curve

Conclusion: Redux doesn't offer advantages for our use case.

### **SA (Software Architect)**
What if we chose **Pure SWR** (no Context)?
- ❌ UI state feels awkward in SWR
- ❌ Role switching harder to implement
- ❌ Less idiomatic React

Conclusion: Context adds value for UI state.

### **PE (Performance Engineer)**
What if we chose **Zustand**?
- ✓ Good for UI state
- ❌ Need to build caching for server state
- ❌ More code to write and maintain

Conclusion: SWR's built-in features save time.

### **RE (Requirements Engineer)**
Requirements check against alternatives:

**All approaches meet requirements**, but:
- Hybrid = Simplest implementation
- Hybrid = Best performance
- Hybrid = Lowest maintenance

Hybrid wins.

## ✅ CONSENSUS REACHED

**Decision**: **Hybrid Approach (SWR + Context API)**

**Unanimous Vote**: 5/5 participants approve

**Implementation Guidelines**:

1. **SWR for Server State**:
   - Analytics data (all 19 categories)
   - User profiles
   - Organization data
   - Reports
   - External microservice responses

2. **Context API for UI State**:
   - Current active role
   - Dashboard preferences
   - Filter selections
   - Theme/accessibility settings
   - Notifications

3. **File Structure**:
```

│   ├── analytics/
│   │   ├── useLearnerAnalytics.js
│   │   ├── useTrainerAnalytics.js
│   │   └── useOrgAnalytics.js

│   └── PreferencesContext.jsx
├── services/
│   └── analyticsService.js
└── config/
    └── swrConfig.js
```

4. **Global SWR Config**:
```javascript
{
  fetcher: authenticatedFetcher,
  revalidateOnFocus: false,
  dedupingInterval: 5000,
  errorRetryCount: 3,
  errorRetryInterval: 2000,
  onError: globalErrorHandler
}
```

5. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for SWR hooks
   - Integration tests for Context + SWR
   - Component tests with mock data
   - Performance tests (< 2.5s load)

**Next Steps**:
- Document decision in ADR-001
- Create implementation guide
- Setup SWR config
- Create base contexts
- Proceed to next debate topic
