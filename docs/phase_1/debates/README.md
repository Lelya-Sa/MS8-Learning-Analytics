## 🎯 Key Decisions Summary

### 1. Frontend State Management
**Decision**: Hybrid (SWR + Context API)
- **SWR** for server state (analytics data, user profiles, reports)
- **Context API** for UI state (role switching, theme, preferences)
- **Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, best performance, minimal dependencies
- **Impact**: Fast dashboard loads (< 100ms cached), simple developer experience

### 2. Backend Job Queue
**Decision**: pg-boss (PostgreSQL-based Job Queue)
- Uses existing PostgreSQL (no Redis needed)
- Built-in retries, scheduling, status tracking
- **Rationale**: $0 additional cost, sufficient performance (500 jobs/sec), Railway-friendly
- **Impact**: Daily batch processing, async "fresh data" requests

### 3. Database Migration Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid (Prisma Migrate + SQL Migrations)
- **Prisma** for core schema (tables, columns, relationships)
- **SQL** for advanced features (RLS policies, materialized views, partitioning)
- **Rationale**: Type safety + PostgreSQL power
- **Impact**: Fast schema changes with Prisma, full PostgreSQL features when needed

### 4. External Microservice Mock Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid (Backend Fallback + MSW for Testing)
- **Backend** owns fallback logic (circuit breaker, retry, partial data)
- **MSW** for frontend tests (fast, reliable, no external dependencies)
- **Rationale**: Production-safe fallback, offline development, reliable tests
- **Impact**: Resilient to microservice outages, fast development

### 5. Test Coverage Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid (TDD for new + Risk-based for existing)
- **TDD** for all new features (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **Risk-based** prioritization for existing code (auth 100%, analytics 95%, UI 85%)
- **Rationale**: Quality from day 1, pragmatic coverage, fast feedback
- **Impact**: 85%+ coverage, tests complete in < 5 min, CI/CD integrated

## 📊 Decision Impact Matrix

| Decision Area | Primary Benefit | Secondary Benefit | Risk Mitigation |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Frontend State | Fast UX (< 100ms cache) | Simple DX | Clear SWR vs Context boundaries |
| Backend Jobs | $0 additional cost | 500 jobs/sec capacity | Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures |
| Database | Type safety (Prisma) | PostgreSQL power (SQL) | Hybrid approach covers 100% of needs |
| Mock Data | Offline development | Resilient production | Backend owns fallback, not frontend |
| Test Coverage | Quality from day 1 (TDD) | 85%+ coverage | Risk-based prioritization prevents wasted effort |

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. ✅ **15-round format** - Sufficient depth without endless debate
2. ✅ **Multi-role participation** - Diverse perspectives caught issues early
3. ✅ **Hybrid decisions** - Pragmatic "best of both worlds" approach
4. ✅ **Unanimous consensus** - All participants bought in
5. ✅ **Documentation** - Each debate self-contained and referenceable

### Key Patterns
1. 🔄 **Hybrid approaches** - Combined strengths of multiple options (5/5 debates chose hybrid)
2. 💰 **Cost consciousness** - Avoided unnecessary paid services ($0 additional infrastructure)
3. 🚀 **MVP pragmatism** - Chose simpler solutions, documented upgrade paths
4. 📊 **Data-driven** - Used metrics and benchmarks to validate decisions
5. 🧪 **Testability** - Every decision considered testing implications

### Avoided Pitfalls
- ❌ Over-engineering (e.g., didn't choose BullMQ when pg-boss sufficient)
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (chose open source, easy-to-replace libraries)
- ❌ Premature optimization (chose simple solutions with clear upgrade paths)
- ❌ Dogmatic purity (chose hybrid approaches over ideological "purity")
