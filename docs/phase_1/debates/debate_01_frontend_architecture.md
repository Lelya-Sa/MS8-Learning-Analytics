# Debate #1: Frontend Architecture Pattern

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Phase:** Phase 2A - Frontend Architecture  
**Topic:** Should we use Onion Architecture for the frontend, and how should it be structured?  
**Participants:** TL (Tech Lead), SA (Solution Architect), FE (Frontend Engineer), UX (UX Designer), PE (Performance Engineer), DA (Data Architect)  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Consensus Reached  

---

## 🎯 **Debate Question**

Should we adopt Onion Architecture for the frontend, and if so, how should the 4 layers (Domain, Infrastructure, Application, Presentation) be organized to balance separation of concerns with developer productivity?

---

## 📋 **Context**

**Current State:**
- Frontend has mixed organization (components/, hooks/, services/ at same level)
- No clear separation between business logic and UI
- Difficult to test business logic independently
- Code duplication across similar components

**Requirements:**
- 19 analytics categories across 3 roles
- Complex business logic (caching, RBAC, data transformations)
- Need framework-agnostic core (future TypeScript migration)
- High testability requirements (85%+ coverage)

**Key Constraints:**
- React + Vite + Tailwind CSS stack
- Must support code splitting by features
- Must maintain fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Must be developer-friendly (not overly complex)

---

## 💬 **Debate Transcript (15 Rounds)**

### **Round 1: Initial Positions**

**TL:** "We need a scalable architecture that separates concerns. The current frontend structure is mixed - components in various folders without clear boundaries. I propose we adopt a clean architecture pattern."

**SA:** "I agree with TL. Onion Architecture is typically backend-focused, but the principles apply to frontend. We need layers: Domain (core business logic), Application (use cases), Infrastructure (API/external), and Presentation (UI)."

**FE:** "I'm skeptical. React best practices suggest feature-based folders, not layer-based. If we go with Onion, components will be scattered across layers. How do I find a 'Button' component - is it in Domain or Presentation?"

**UX:** "I care about user experience, not folder structure. Whatever architecture we choose, it should make components easy to find and reuse. Don't make developers hunt through 4 layers to build a simple feature."

**PE:** "Performance is my concern. If Onion Architecture leads to circular dependencies or bloated bundles, we'll have slow load times. We need code splitting by features, not layers."

**DA:** "From a data perspective, I like the idea of a Domain layer. We need a single source of truth for data types, entities, and business rules. This will prevent inconsistencies between components."

---

### **Round 2: Clarifications**

**FE:** "SA, can you clarify what goes in each layer? Give me concrete examples. Where does a 'SkillGapMatrix' component go? What about the 'useAnalytics' hook?"

**SA:** "Good question. Here's my proposal:
- **Domain**: Entities (User, Analytics), Types (JSDoc types), Interfaces (service contracts), Constants (roles, analytics types)
- **Application**: Hooks (useAnalytics, useAuth), Services (analyticsService, authService), State (AuthContext)
- **Infrastructure**: API clients (analyticsApiClient), Utils (formatters, validators), External (Chart.js wrapper)
- **Presentation**: Pages (LearnerDashboard), Components (SkillGapMatrix), Layouts (DashboardLayout), Assets (CSS, images)"

**UX:** "So UI components are in Presentation. That's fine. But what's in Domain if not components? Just types?"

**DA:** "Domain is where we define WHAT the system does, not HOW it looks. For example:
```javascript
// domain/entities/Analytics.js
class Analytics {
  constructor(userId, analyticsType, data) {
    this.userId = userId;
    this.analyticsType = analyticsType;
    this.data = data;
  }
  
  isStale(ttl) {
    // Business logic to check if data is stale
    return Date.now() - this.calculatedAt > ttl;
  }
}
```
This is core business logic, independent of React or any UI framework."

**FE:** "Okay, I see the value in separating business logic from UI. But React components ARE the business logic in many cases. A 'SkillGapMatrix' doesn't just display data - it calculates priorities, filters gaps, sorts by importance. Where does that logic go?"

**SA:** "That's exactly the point! The calculation logic goes in Application layer (a service or hook), the component in Presentation layer just displays it. Separation of concerns."

**PE:** "But won't that hurt performance? Now I'm making a service call, then passing data to a component. That's more overhead."

**TL:** "PE, the overhead is negligible. The benefit is testability - we can unit test the business logic without rendering components. And we can reuse logic across multiple components."

---

### **Round 3: Concerns and Challenges**

**FE:** "I'm still concerned about developer experience. If I'm building a new feature, I have to create files in 4 different folders:
1. Domain: Define the entity type
2. Infrastructure: Create an API client method
3. Application: Create a service and hook
4. Presentation: Create the UI component

That's a lot of ceremony for a simple feature!"

**UX:** "FE makes a good point. If the architecture slows down development, we'll miss deadlines. Speed matters."

**SA:** "I hear you, but think long-term. Yes, initial setup is more work. But when we need to change business logic, we change ONE file in Application layer, not 10 components in Presentation layer. When we swap out our API client (e.g., from Axios to Fetch), we change ONE file in Infrastructure, not scattered throughout components."

**DA:** "And when we add TypeScript in the future, all our types are already defined in Domain. No refactoring needed."

**PE:** "What about bundle size? If everything is imported from Domain → Infrastructure → Application → Presentation, won't we have massive bundle dependencies?"

**TL:** "Good question. We'll use dynamic imports and code splitting at the Presentation layer. Each page lazy-loads its dependencies. The Onion layers don't prevent tree-shaking - unused code still gets eliminated."

**BE:** "From a full-stack perspective, having the same architecture on frontend and backend makes sense. I use Onion Architecture in our Node.js backend. If frontend mirrors it, developers can switch between frontend and backend more easily."

**FE:** "Okay, I'm warming up to this. But I need a clear guideline: when building a feature, what goes in which layer? Can we create a decision tree?"

**SA:** "Yes! Here's a simple rule:
- **Domain**: If it's a business rule that would exist even if we changed from React to Vue → Domain
- **Infrastructure**: If it's talking to external systems (API, localStorage, browser APIs) → Infrastructure
- **Application**: If it's orchestrating domain logic and infrastructure → Application
- **Presentation**: If it's UI rendering, styling, user interactions → Presentation"

---

### **Round 4: Alternatives Consideration**

**FE:** "Let me propose an alternative: Feature-based architecture. We've seen it work well in many React projects:
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── learner-analytics/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── types/
│   ├── trainer-analytics/
│   └── comparison/
└── shared/
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    └── utils/
```
Everything for a feature is co-located. Easy to find, easy to delete if a feature is removed."

**UX:** "I like this! It's intuitive. If I want to work on 'learner-analytics', I go to one folder."

**PE:** "Feature-based also makes code splitting trivial. Each feature is a natural split point."

**SA:** "Feature-based is good for small apps, but we have 19 analytics categories across 3 roles. That's 19+ features. How do we share logic between Learner Analytics and Trainer Analytics? Do we duplicate code in each feature folder?"

**DA:** "SA is right. We'll have shared entities (User, Organization), shared services (API client), shared business logic (caching, RBAC). Feature-based architecture leads to duplication or a massive 'shared' folder that becomes a dumping ground."

**TL:** "What if we combine both? Onion Architecture at the top level for shared concerns, feature-based organization within Presentation layer?"

**FE:** "That's interesting! So:
```
src/
├── domain/          # Shared entities, types
├── infrastructure/  # Shared API clients, utils
├── application/     # Shared hooks, services
└── presentation/    # Feature-based organization
    ├── features/
    │   ├── learner-analytics/
    │   ├── trainer-analytics/
    │   └── comparison/
    └── shared/
        └── components/
```
This gives us the best of both worlds!"

**SA:** "I'm open to this hybrid approach. But let's be clear: features in Presentation layer can only depend on Application and Infrastructure layers, never on each other. No cross-feature imports."

**UX:** "I support this hybrid. It's organized but not rigid."

**PE:** "As long as we can code-split by feature, I'm happy."

---

### **Round 5: Deep Dive on Domain Layer**

**DA:** "Let's get specific about the Domain layer. What exactly goes here? I propose:
1. **Entities**: Business objects (User, Analytics, Comparison, Gamification)
2. **Types**: JSDoc type definitions (LearningVelocity, SkillGap, PeerComparison)
3. **Interfaces**: Service contracts (IAnalyticsService, IAuthService)
4. **Constants**: Business constants (USER_ROLES, ANALYTICS_CATEGORIES, CACHE_TTL)"

**FE:** "Why do we need Interfaces? We're using JavaScript, not TypeScript. Interfaces don't exist at runtime."

**DA:** "Interfaces are documentation and contracts. They tell developers: 'If you implement AnalyticsService, you MUST provide these methods.' It's self-documenting code. Example:
```javascript
// domain/interfaces/IAnalyticsService.js
export const IAnalyticsService = {
  /**
   * Get learner velocity analytics
   * @param {string} userId
   * @returns {Promise<LearningVelocity>}
   */
  getLearnerVelocity: (userId) => Promise.resolve({}),
  
  /**
   * Get skill gap matrix
   * @param {string} userId
   * @returns {Promise<SkillGapMatrix>}
   */
  getSkillGapMatrix: (userId) => Promise.resolve({}),
};
```
Now anyone implementing this service knows exactly what methods and signatures are required."

**TL:** "I like this. It's like an API contract. When we write tests, we can mock the interface."

**SE:** "From a security perspective, having constants in Domain layer is good. We define USER_ROLES once:
```javascript
export const USER_ROLES = {
  LEARNER: 'learner',
  TRAINER: 'trainer',
  ORG_ADMIN: 'org_admin',
  SUPER_ADMIN: 'super_admin',
};
```
Now we can't have typos like 'orgAdmin' vs 'org_admin' scattered in code."

**FE:** "Okay, I'm convinced on Domain layer. But entities - do we really need classes? Can we just use plain objects?"

**SA:** "Classes are optional. If your entity has behavior (methods), use a class. If it's just data, use a plain object or a factory function. Example:
```javascript
// domain/entities/User.js
export class User {
  constructor(id, email, roles, organizationId) {
    this.id = id;
    this.email = email;
    this.roles = roles;
    this.organizationId = organizationId;
    this.currentRole = roles[0];
  }
  
  hasRole(role) {
    return this.roles.includes(role);
  }
  
  canAccessOrganization(orgId) {
    return this.organizationId === orgId || this.hasRole('super_admin');
  }
}
```
This business logic belongs in Domain, not in React components."

**UX:** "As long as components can use these entities easily, I'm fine with it."

---

### **Round 6: Deep Dive on Infrastructure Layer**

**IE:** "Let's talk Infrastructure layer. This is where we interact with external systems: APIs, browser storage, external libraries. I propose:
1. **API clients**: HTTP clients for backend communication
2. **Config**: Environment variables, constants
3. **Utils**: Pure utility functions (date formatting, validation)
4. **External**: Wrappers for external libraries (Chart.js, SWR config)"

**FE:** "Why wrap external libraries? Can't we just import Chart.js directly in components?"

**PE:** "Wrapping is a best practice. If Chart.js releases a breaking change (v5 to v6), we update ONE wrapper file, not 20 components. Also, we can optimize bundle size by lazy-loading the chart library."

**IE:** "Exactly. Example:
```javascript
// infrastructure/external/chartWrapper.js
import { Chart } from 'chart.js/auto';

export const createChart = (canvasRef, config) => {
  return new Chart(canvasRef, {
    ...config,
    options: {
      ...config.options,
      responsive: true,
      maintainAspectRatio: false,
      // Global chart defaults
    },
  });
};
```
Now all charts have consistent options. And if we switch from Chart.js to Recharts, we update the wrapper."

**DA:** "What about API clients? Should we have one big client or multiple small clients?"

**SA:** "Multiple small clients, organized by domain:
```
infrastructure/api/
├── apiClient.js          # Base HTTP client (Axios instance)
├── analyticsApiClient.js # All analytics endpoints
├── authApiClient.js      # All auth endpoints
├── reportApiClient.js    # All report endpoints
└── comparisonApiClient.js # All comparison endpoints
```
Each client exports functions for specific endpoints."

**SE:** "API clients should handle authentication automatically. The base client adds JWT to headers:
```javascript
// infrastructure/api/apiClient.js
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL,
});

apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('jwt');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Token expired, redirect to login
      window.location.href = '/login';
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);

export default apiClient;
```
Now all API clients get auth handling for free."

**FE:** "I like this. Infrastructure layer is starting to make sense - it's the 'plumbing' that connects us to external systems."

---

### **Round 7: Deep Dive on Application Layer**

**FE:** "Okay, Application layer. This is where hooks and services live, right? Walk me through a complete example."

**SA:** "Application layer orchestrates Domain and Infrastructure. Here's a full example for learner velocity:

**Step 1: Service (Application layer)**
```javascript
// application/services/analyticsService.js
import { analyticsApiClient } from '../../infrastructure/api/analyticsApiClient';
import { LearningVelocity } from '../../domain/types/AnalyticsTypes';

export const analyticsService = {
  async getLearnerVelocity(userId) {
    try {
      const response = await analyticsApiClient.getLearnerVelocity(userId);
      
      // Business logic: validate response
      if (!response.data) {
        throw new Error('Invalid response format');
      }
      
      // Transform API response to domain type
      return new LearningVelocity(response.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Analytics service error:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  },
};
```

**Step 2: Hook (Application layer)**
```javascript
// application/hooks/useAnalytics.js
import useSWR from 'swr';
import { analyticsService } from '../services/analyticsService';

export const useLearnerVelocity = (userId) => {
  return useSWR(
    userId ? ['learner-velocity', userId] : null,
    () => analyticsService.getLearnerVelocity(userId),
    {
      revalidateOnFocus: false,
      revalidateIfStale: false,
      dedupingInterval: 14400000, // 4 hours
    }
  );
};
```

**Step 3: Component (Presentation layer)**
```javascript
// presentation/features/learner-analytics/LearnerVelocity.jsx
import { useLearnerVelocity } from '../../../application/hooks/useAnalytics';

export const LearnerVelocity = ({ userId }) => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useLearnerVelocity(userId);
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage error={error} />;
  
  return (
    <div className=\"analytics-card\">
      <h3>Learning Velocity</h3>
      <p>Current Pace: {data.currentPace} topics/week</p>
      <p>Trend: {data.trend}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```
See how each layer has a clear responsibility?"

**FE:** "Yes! The service handles API calls and error handling. The hook manages caching and state. The component just renders. This is clean!"

**TL:** "And testable. We can mock the service in hook tests, mock the hook in component tests. Each layer tests independently."

**DA:** "What about complex business logic? For example, calculating if a learner is 'on track' based on pace variance. Where does that go?"

**SA:** "If it's pure calculation (no side effects), it can go in Domain as a utility function:
```javascript
// domain/utils/analyticsCalculations.js
export const isOnTrack = (currentPace, targetPace, variance = 0.8) => {
  return currentPace >= (targetPace * variance);
};
```
Then Application service uses it:
```javascript
// application/services/analyticsService.js
import { isOnTrack } from '../../domain/utils/analyticsCalculations';

export const analyticsService = {
  async getLearnerVelocity(userId) {
    const response = await analyticsApiClient.getLearnerVelocity(userId);
    const data = response.data;
    
    // Apply business logic
    data.onTrack = isOnTrack(data.currentPace, data.targetPace);
    
    return data;
  },
};
```"

**UX:** "I'm starting to see the benefits. When we change how 'on track' is calculated, we change ONE function, and all components using it get updated automatically."

---

### **Round 8: Deep Dive on Presentation Layer**

**FE:** "Now Presentation layer. You mentioned feature-based organization. Let's design the structure:
```
presentation/
├── features/           # Feature-based modules
│   ├── learner-analytics/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── LearnerVelocity.jsx
│   │   │   ├── SkillGapMatrix.jsx
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   │   └── LearnerDashboard.jsx
│   │   └── index.js  # Public exports
│   ├── trainer-analytics/
│   ├── comparison/
│   └── predictive/
├── shared/             # Shared UI components
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Button.jsx
│   │   ├── Card.jsx
│   │   ├── LoadingSpinner.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   └── layouts/
│       ├── DashboardLayout.jsx
│       └── AuthLayout.jsx
├── pages/              # Top-level route pages
│   ├── HomePage.jsx
│   ├── LoginPage.jsx
│   └── ...
└── assets/             # Static assets
    ├── css/
    ├── images/
    └── fonts/
```
Does this work?"

**UX:** "I like it! Features are grouped together. Shared components are easily findable. This is developer-friendly."

**SA:** "One concern: How do we prevent features from importing from each other? We don't want `learner-analytics` importing from `trainer-analytics`."

**TL:** "We enforce it with linting rules. ESLint can check import paths:
```javascript
// .eslintrc.js
rules: {
  'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
    patterns: ['**/features/**/!(index)']  // Can't import internals of other features
  }]
}
```
Features can only import from `application/`, `infrastructure/`, `domain/`, and `presentation/shared/`."

**PE:** "For performance, I want to ensure each feature is code-split:
```javascript
// App.jsx
import { lazy } from 'react';

const LearnerDashboard = lazy(() => import('./features/learner-analytics/pages/LearnerDashboard'));
const TrainerDashboard = lazy(() => import('./features/trainer-analytics/pages/TrainerDashboard'));
```
This way, learners don't download trainer code."

**FE:** "Agreed. What about pages vs components? What's the difference?"

**SA:** "`pages/` are route-level components (top-level URLs like `/`, `/login`, `/dashboard`). `features/*/pages/` are feature-specific pages (like `/dashboard/learner`). `components/` are reusable UI pieces."

**UX:** "What about responsiveness? Where do we handle mobile vs desktop layouts?"

**FE:** "Tailwind CSS handles responsiveness with utility classes:
```jsx
<div className=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4\">
  {/* 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop */}
</div>
```
For complex layout changes, we use `layouts/` components that adapt based on screen size."

---

### **Round 9: Dependency Rules and Constraints**

**SA:** "Let's formalize dependency rules. In Onion Architecture, dependencies flow inward:

**Allowed Dependencies:**
- `Presentation` → `Application`, `Infrastructure`, `Domain`
- `Application` → `Infrastructure`, `Domain`
- `Infrastructure` → `Domain`
- `Domain` → NOTHING (zero external dependencies)

**Forbidden Dependencies:**
- `Domain` → anything else
- `Infrastructure` → `Application` or `Presentation`
- `Application` → `Presentation`

This ensures Domain layer is framework-agnostic."

**FE:** "How do we enforce this? Can we use tooling?"

**TL:** "Yes, with dependency-cruiser or ESLint. We create a config:
```javascript
// .dependency-cruiser.js
module.exports = {
  forbidden: [
    {
      name: 'domain-no-deps',
      from: { path: 'src/domain' },
      to: { path: 'src/(application|infrastructure|presentation)' },
    },
    {
      name: 'infrastructure-no-app',
      from: { path: 'src/infrastructure' },
      to: { path: 'src/(application|presentation)' },
    },
    {
      name: 'application-no-ui',
      from: { path: 'src/application' },
      to: { path: 'src/presentation' },
    },
  ],
};
```
Run `dependency-cruiser --validate` in CI. Build fails if rules are violated."

**DA:** "This is good. It prevents accidental coupling. Once we ship, the architecture stays clean."

**SE:** "From a security standpoint, this also helps. We can audit Infrastructure layer for security vulnerabilities without worrying about Domain or Application importing unsafe code."

---

### **Round 10: Testing Strategy Per Layer**

**FE:** "How do we test each layer? Give me concrete examples."

**SA:** "Each layer has a different testing approach:

**Domain Layer Tests (Pure logic, no mocks)**
```javascript
// domain/utils/analyticsCalculations.test.js
import { isOnTrack } from './analyticsCalculations';

describe('isOnTrack', () => {
  it('returns true when current pace meets target', () => {
    expect(isOnTrack(2.5, 2.0)).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('returns false when current pace is below 80% of target', () => {
    expect(isOnTrack(1.0, 2.0)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

**Infrastructure Layer Tests (Mock external systems)**
```javascript
// infrastructure/api/analyticsApiClient.test.js
import { analyticsApiClient } from './analyticsApiClient';
import apiClient from './apiClient';

vi.mock('./apiClient');

describe('analyticsApiClient', () => {
  it('fetches learner velocity', async () => {
    apiClient.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { currentPace: 2.5 } });
    
    const result = await analyticsApiClient.getLearnerVelocity('user-123');
    
    expect(apiClient.get).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/api/v1/analytics/learner/velocity/user-123');
    expect(result.data.currentPace).toBe(2.5);
  });
});
```

**Application Layer Tests (Mock Infrastructure)**
```javascript
// application/services/analyticsService.test.js
import { analyticsService } from './analyticsService';
import { analyticsApiClient } from '../../infrastructure/api/analyticsApiClient';

vi.mock('../../infrastructure/api/analyticsApiClient');

describe('analyticsService', () => {
  it('transforms API response to domain type', async () => {
    analyticsApiClient.getLearnerVelocity.mockResolvedValue({
      data: { currentPace: 2.5, averagePace: 1.8 }
    });
    
    const result = await analyticsService.getLearnerVelocity('user-123');
    
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('currentPace', 2.5);
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('averagePace', 1.8);
  });
});
```

**Presentation Layer Tests (Mock Application hooks)**
```javascript
// presentation/features/learner-analytics/LearnerVelocity.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { LearnerVelocity } from './LearnerVelocity';
import { useLearnerVelocity } from '../../../application/hooks/useAnalytics';

vi.mock('../../../application/hooks/useAnalytics');

describe('LearnerVelocity', () => {
  it('displays current pace', () => {
    useLearnerVelocity.mockReturnValue({
      data: { currentPace: 2.5, trend: 'accelerating' },
      error: null,
      isLoading: false,
    });
    
    render(<LearnerVelocity userId=\"user-123\" />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText(/2.5/)).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText(/accelerating/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
See how each layer mocks the layer below it?"

**TL:** "This is the key benefit of Onion Architecture. Tests are fast because we're not rendering components or making API calls in every test. Each layer tests its own responsibility."

**PE:** "And we get high coverage without slow E2E tests. Unit tests are fast (< 1ms per test), integration tests are moderate (< 100ms), E2E tests are slow (seconds). With Onion Architecture, 70% of our tests are fast unit tests."

---

### **Round 11: Migration Path**

**FE:** "Okay, I'm convinced. But we have existing code. How do we migrate without breaking everything?"

**TL:** "Good question. We'll migrate incrementally:

**Phase 1: Create new folder structure (no code changes)**
```
src/
├── domain/              # Empty initially
├── infrastructure/      # Empty initially
├── application/         # Empty initially
├── presentation/        # Move existing components/ here
└── legacy/              # Move existing hooks/, services/ here temporarily
```

**Phase 2: Extract Domain layer**
- Identify types currently in components → Move to `domain/types/`
- Extract constants → Move to `domain/constants/`
- Create interfaces for services → Add to `domain/interfaces/`

**Phase 3: Refactor Infrastructure layer**
- Extract API client logic from services → Move to `infrastructure/api/`
- Extract utility functions → Move to `infrastructure/utils/`
- Wrap external libraries → Add to `infrastructure/external/`

**Phase 4: Refactor Application layer**
- Refactor services to use new API clients → Move to `application/services/`
- Refactor hooks to use new services → Move to `application/hooks/`

**Phase 5: Refactor Presentation layer**
- Organize components into features → Move to `presentation/features/`
- Extract shared components → Move to `presentation/shared/`

**Phase 6: Delete legacy/ folder**

Each phase is a separate PR. We can deploy after each phase without breaking production."

**SA:** "I recommend we start with ONE feature as a pilot. Migrate 'learner velocity' analytics end-to-end. Once that's working, we have a template for other features."

**FE:** "That's smart. We'll learn the pain points and adjust before migrating everything."

**UX:** "As long as users don't see any disruption, I'm happy. This is an internal refactor."

---

### **Round 12: Tooling and IDE Support**

**FE:** "What about IDE support? Will autocomplete work across layers?"

**TL:** "Yes, we'll configure jsconfig.json for absolute imports:
```json
{
  \"compilerOptions\": {
    \"baseUrl\": \"src\",
    \"paths\": {
      \"@domain/*\": [\"domain/*\"],
      \"@infrastructure/*\": [\"infrastructure/*\"],
      \"@application/*\": [\"application/*\"],
      \"@presentation/*\": [\"presentation/*\"]
    }
  }
}
```
Now you can import with:
```javascript
import { User } from '@domain/entities/User';
import { analyticsService } from '@application/services/analyticsService';
```
VS Code will autocomplete these paths."

**PE:** "Make sure Vite is configured to resolve these paths too:
```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@domain': '/src/domain',
      '@infrastructure': '/src/infrastructure',
      '@application': '/src/application',
      '@presentation': '/src/presentation',
    },
  },
};
```"

**DA:** "For documentation, we should add README files in each layer explaining what belongs there."

**SA:** "Agree. Let's create:
- `domain/README.md`: Explains entities, types, interfaces, constants
- `infrastructure/README.md`: Explains API clients, utils, external wrappers
- `application/README.md`: Explains hooks, services, use cases
- `presentation/README.md`: Explains features, shared components, pages"

### **Round 13: Performance Implications**

**PE:** "Let me deep-dive on performance. I'm concerned about:
1. **Bundle size**: Will Onion Architecture increase bundle size?
2. **Runtime overhead**: Will extra abstraction layers slow down the app?
3. **Code splitting**: Can we still split by features?

Let's address each."

**SA:** "1. **Bundle size**: No increase. Tree-shaking still works. Unused code is eliminated regardless of folder structure.

2. **Runtime overhead**: Negligible. Function calls are cheap (nanoseconds). The overhead of calling `analyticsService.getLearnerVelocity()` vs directly calling `fetch()` is immeasurable.

3. **Code splitting**: Yes! We split at Presentation layer:
```javascript
const LearnerDashboard = lazy(() => import('@presentation/features/learner-analytics/pages/LearnerDashboard'));
```
Vite automatically creates separate chunks for each feature."

**PE:** "What about the initial bundle? If every component imports from Domain → Infrastructure → Application, won't the entry point be huge?"

**TL:** "No, because we lazy-load features. The entry point only loads:
- Router
- AuthProvider (small)
- Error boundary (small)
- Landing page (small)

Dashboards are loaded on-demand. So initial bundle is tiny (~50KB gzipped)."

**FE:** "What about development performance? Will hot module replacement (HMR) be slow?"

**PE:** "HMR speed depends on module graph, not folder structure. Since we're using Vite, HMR is fast (< 50ms). Onion Architecture doesn't affect this."

**DA:** "What about memory usage? Are we loading everything into memory?"

**SA:** "No. React only keeps mounted components in memory. Unmounted components are garbage collected. The Onion layers don't add memory overhead."

---

### **Round 14: Comparison with Alternatives**

**FE:** "Before we finalize, let's compare Onion Architecture with alternatives one more time:

**Alternative 1: Flat structure** (no layers)
```
src/
├── components/
├── hooks/
├── utils/
└── services/
```
**Pros**: Simple, easy to understand
**Cons**: No separation of concerns, hard to scale, business logic mixed with UI

**Alternative 2: Feature-based** (no layers)
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── learner-analytics/ (has components, hooks, services, utils)
│   └── trainer-analytics/
└── shared/
```
**Pros**: Co-located, easy to find related code
**Cons**: Duplication across features, no shared business logic layer

**Alternative 3: Onion Architecture** (layered)
```
src/
├── domain/
├── infrastructure/
├── application/
└── presentation/
    └── features/  (feature-based within presentation)
```
**Pros**: Separation of concerns, testable, scalable, framework-agnostic, shared business logic
**Cons**: More ceremony, steeper learning curve"

**SA:** "I still vote for Alternative 3 (Onion Architecture) because:
1. We have 19 analytics categories - we NEED shared business logic
2. We'll integrate with 9 external microservices - we NEED an Infrastructure layer to abstract them
3. We have complex caching, RBAC, and business rules - we NEED an Application layer
4. We want to keep UI flexible (might switch from Vite to Next.js) - we NEED framework-agnostic Domain layer"

**UX:** "I was skeptical at first, but Alternative 3 with feature-based Presentation layer gives us the best of both worlds. I'm on board."

**PE:** "Performance-wise, all three alternatives are equivalent. So I'll go with the most maintainable option: Onion Architecture."

**DA:** "From a data perspective, Onion Architecture gives us a single source of truth for types and entities. That's huge for consistency. I vote Onion."

**TL:** "Looks like we have consensus on Onion Architecture."

### **Round 15: Final Decision and Action Items**

**TL:** "Let's formalize our decision:

**✅ DECISION: Adopt Onion Architecture for Frontend**

**4 Layers:**
1. **Domain** (innermost): Entities, Types, Interfaces, Constants - zero external dependencies
2. **Infrastructure**: API clients, Config, Utils, External library wrappers
3. **Application**: Hooks, Services, State management, Use cases
4. **Presentation** (outermost): Feature-based organization with Pages, Components, Layouts, Assets

**Folder Structure:**
```
frontend/src/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/       # Business entities (User, Analytics, etc.)
│   ├── types/          # Type definitions (JSDoc)
│   ├── interfaces/     # Service contracts
│   └── constants/      # Business constants
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── api/            # API clients
│   ├── config/         # Configuration
│   ├── utils/          # Utility functions
│   └── external/       # External library wrappers
├── application/
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
│   ├── services/       # Business logic services
│   ├── state/          # Global state (Context)
│   └── use-cases/      # Application use cases
└── presentation/
    ├── features/       # Feature-based modules
    │   ├── learner-analytics/
    │   ├── trainer-analytics/
    │   ├── organization-analytics/
    │   ├── comparison/
    │   └── predictive/
    ├── shared/         # Shared UI components
    │   ├── components/
    │   └── layouts/
    ├── pages/          # Top-level route pages
    └── assets/         # Static assets
```

**Dependency Rules:**
- Presentation → Application, Infrastructure, Domain
- Application → Infrastructure, Domain
- Infrastructure → Domain
- Domain → NOTHING

**Action Items:**
1. [SA] Create detailed folder structure document → `docs/frontend_architecture.md`
2. [FE] Create migration plan (6 phases) → `docs/frontend_migration_plan.md`
3. [TL] Set up ESLint rules for dependency enforcement
4. [FE] Create README for each layer
5. [TL] Configure jsconfig.json for absolute imports
6. [PE] Configure Vite for alias resolution
7. [FE] Pilot migration with 'learner velocity' feature
8. [TL] Code review checklist for Onion Architecture compliance

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Separation of concerns
- ✅ Framework-agnostic Domain layer
