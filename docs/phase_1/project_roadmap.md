## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1: External Microservices Unstable**
- **Impact**: HIGH (data collection fails)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Circuit breaker + mock data fallback + warnings in UI
- **Contingency**: Operate with mock data until MS stabilize

**Risk 2: Timeline Slippage (19 Analytics Too Ambitious)**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (delayed launch)
- **Probability**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize 8 critical analytics for MVP, implement rest in Phase 2
- **Contingency**: Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks if needed

**Risk 3: External MS API Contracts Change**
- **Impact**: HIGH (integration breaks)
- **Probability**: LOW
- **Mitigation**: Version API contracts, monitor for changes, alerting
- **Contingency**: Adjust integration layer, use fallback data temporarily

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Risk 4: Database Performance Degrades**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (slow queries)
- **Probability**: LOW
- **Mitigation**: Partitioning, materialized views, caching, query optimization
- **Contingency**: Add indexes, optimize queries, increase database resources

**Risk 5: Test Coverage Goal Not Met**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (quality concerns)
- **Probability**: LOW
- **Mitigation**: TDD from day 1, enforce coverage gates in CI/CD
- **Contingency**: Extend testing phase, add more tests for uncovered code
