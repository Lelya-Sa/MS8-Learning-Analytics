### 2. **Extended Mediated Debates** ✅
**Folder**: `docs/phase_1/debates/`

#### **Debate #6: Full-Stack Architecture Type** (35 rounds)
**Document**: `debate_06_full_stack_architecture.md`

**Decision**: **Full-Stack Onion Architecture with Vibe Engineering**

**Key Points**:
- **Scope**: FULL STACK (Frontend + Backend)
- **Vibe Engineering**: Same architectural patterns across entire stack
- **4 Layers**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation (both frontend and backend)
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward
- **Ports & Adapters**: All external integrations via interfaces
- **Productivity Gain**: 15-20% time savings (1-1.5 weeks in MVP)
- **Security**: 6 layers (3 frontend + 3 backend)
- **Testability**: 85%+ coverage achievable

**Structure**:
```
MS8-Learning-Analytics/
├── frontend/src/
│   ├── domain/              # Pure business logic
│   ├── application/         # Use cases + ports + state
│   ├── infrastructure/      # API client, storage
│   └── presentation/        # React components
├── backend/src/
│   ├── domain/              # Pure business logic

│   └── presentation/        # Express routes, controllers
└── shared/                  # Shared types (optional)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Same mental model frontend + backend
- ✅ Easier onboarding (learn once, apply everywhere)
- ✅ Consistent codebase structure
- ✅ Easier to refactor across stack
- ✅ Better code reviews (same patterns everywhere)

**Vote**: 9/9 unanimous approval

#### **Debate #7: Multi-Role Architecture** (25 rounds)
**Document**: `debate_07_multi_role_architecture.md`

**Decision**: **5 Key Architectural Decisions**

**1. Data Storage**: Single table with `(user_id, role, analytics_type)` composite key
```sql
CREATE TABLE analytics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  analytics_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  data JSONB NOT NULL,
  organization_id UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, role, analytics_type)
);
```

**2. Session Management**: Single JWT with roles array, frontend tracks active role via `X-Active-Role` header
```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "roles": ["learner", "trainer"],
  "organizationId": "org-uuid"
}
```

**3. UI Architecture**: Separate routes per role with role switcher in header
- `/dashboard/learner` → `LearnerDashboard.jsx`
- `/dashboard/trainer` → `TrainerDashboard.jsx`
- `/dashboard/org-admin` → `OrgAdminDashboard.jsx`

**4. Analytics Calculation**: Calculate per `(user_id, role)` pair independently (no cross-role data)

**5. RBAC Enforcement**: 3-layer defense in depth
- **Frontend**: Conditional rendering based on `activeRole`
- **Backend Middleware**: `authMiddleware`, `activeRoleMiddleware`, `RBACMiddleware`
- **Database RLS**: Supabase Row-Level Security policies

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Secure (no cross-role data leakage)
- ✅ Clean separation (separate dashboards per role)
- ✅ Good UX (instant role switching, bookmarkable URLs)
- ✅ Maintainable (clear architecture)
- ✅ Testable (each layer independently testable)

**Vote**: 8/8 unanimous approval

#### **Debate #8: Performance Strategy** (25 rounds)
**Document**: `debate_08_performance_strategy.md`

**Decision**: **Hybrid Performance Strategy**

**Components**:
1. **Daily Batch** (02:00 UTC): Calculate all analytics for all user-roles (~2 hours for 10k users)
2. **Staleness Check** (on login): Trigger async recalc if > 6h old
3. **Manual Refresh**: User-triggered, rate-limited (5 per 10 min)
4. **3-Layer Caching**: In-memory (24h) → Database (7d) → Aggregated (7y)

**Performance Targets**:
- Dashboard load: < 100ms (cached), ~45s (first-time)
- API response: < 500ms (cached)
- Batch duration: ~2 hours for 10k users
- Freshness: Max 6h for active users, 24h for inactive

**Modifications from User's Original Proposal**:
- ✅ Kept: Daily batch, manual refresh
- ✅ Modified: On login → staleness check (smarter, on-demand)
- ❌ Removed: Automatic 20min recalc (redundant, 43% load reduction)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simpler (3 mechanisms vs 4)
- ✅ Cheaper (43% fewer calculations, ~$20-30/month savings)
- ✅ Acceptable freshness (6h vs 20min for learning analytics)
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Better resource utilization

**Vote**: 9/9 unanimous approval
