## 🎯 Key Architectural Decisions

### Decision Summary

All 5 debates unanimously chose **hybrid approaches**, demonstrating pragmatic architecture over dogmatic purity:

1. **Frontend State**: SWR (server) + Context (UI)
   - **Why**: Clear separation of concerns, fast UX (< 100ms cache), minimal dependencies (5KB)
   - **Alternative rejected**: Redux (15KB, more boilerplate), pure SWR (UI state awkward)

2. **Backend Jobs**: pg-boss (PostgreSQL-based queue)
   - **Why**: $0 additional cost, 500 jobs/sec (125x more than needed), Railway-friendly
   - **Alternative rejected**: BullMQ + Redis ($15-30/month), simple async (need to rebuild pg-boss features)

3. **Database Migrations**: Prisma (schema) + SQL (advanced features)
   - **Why**: Type safety + PostgreSQL power (RLS, materialized views, partitioning)
   - **Alternative rejected**: Pure Prisma (no RLS/views), pure SQL (no type generation)

4. **Mock Data**: Backend fallback + MSW (testing only)
   - **Why**: Production-safe (resilient to MS outages), offline development, reliable tests
   - **Alternative rejected**: Frontend mocks (not production-safe), mock API server (complex)

5. **Test Coverage**: TDD (new features) + Risk-based (existing code)
   - **Why**: Quality from day 1, 85%+ coverage without excessive effort on low-risk code
   - **Alternative rejected**: Comprehensive from day 1 (slow), incremental (low confidence)

### Common Patterns Across Decisions

**Pragmatism over Dogmatism**:
- All 5 decisions chose hybrid approaches
- Balanced "best of both worlds" instead of ideological purity
- Cost-conscious: Avoided unnecessary paid services ($0 additional infrastructure for MVP)

**MVP-First with Clear Upgrade Paths**:
- Start simple (pg-boss, mock data), document migration to enterprise solutions (BullMQ, real AI)
- No premature optimization
- Clear abstraction layers enable future migration

**Data-Driven Validation**:
- Used metrics and benchmarks (pg-boss: 500 jobs/sec, we need 4 jobs/sec = 125x capacity)
- Performance targets defined upfront (< 2.5s load, < 500ms API)

- **Status**: Mitigated through architecture decisions (Debate #4)

**Risk 2: Timeline Slippage (19 Analytics Too Ambitious)**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (delayed launch)
- **Mitigation**: ✅ Prioritize 8 critical analytics for MVP, defer rest to Phase 2
- **Status**: Roadmap reflects phased implementation

**Risk 3: External MS API Contracts Change**
- **Impact**: HIGH (integration breaks)
- **Mitigation**: ✅ Version API contracts, monitoring, alerting, mock data fallback
- **Status**: Integration architecture includes versioning strategy

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Risk 4: Database Performance Degrades**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (slow queries)
- **Mitigation**: ✅ Partitioning (7-year), materialized views (comparisons), caching (24h), indexes
- **Status**: Database architecture includes performance optimizations

**Risk 5: Test Coverage Goal Not Met**
- **Impact**: MEDIUM (quality concerns)
- **Mitigation**: ✅ TDD from day 1, enforce coverage gates in CI/CD, risk-based prioritization
- **Status**: Test strategy ensures 85%+ coverage (Debate #5)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned (Phase 1A)

### What Worked Well

1. **15-Round Mediated Debates**
   - Provided sufficient depth without endless discussion
   - All participants had time to address concerns
   - Unanimous consensus achieved on all 5 topics

2. **Multi-Role Participation**
   - Diverse perspectives caught issues early (e.g., DevOps highlighted Redis cost)
   - Cross-functional validation prevented siloed decisions

3. **Hybrid Approaches**
   - Pragmatic "best of both worlds" solutions
   - Avoided dogmatic purity (e.g., not "Redux everywhere" or "pure Context")
   - Cost-conscious decisions ($0 additional infrastructure)

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Each debate self-contained and referenceable
   - Requirements Specification covers all aspects (functional, non-functional, technical, data, integration, quality)

### Key Patterns Observed

1. **Cost Consciousness**: Avoided unnecessary paid services (no Redis, no BullMQ for MVP)
2. **MVP Pragmatism**: Chose simpler solutions with clear upgrade paths
3. **Testability First**: Every decision considered testing implications
4. **Security Embedded**: Security discussed in every debate (JWT, RBAC, RLS, K-anonymity)

### Avoided Pitfalls

- ❌ Over-engineering (didn't choose BullMQ when pg-boss sufficient)
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (chose open source, easy-to-replace libraries)
- ❌ Premature optimization (simple solutions first, optimize later)
- ❌ Technology for technology's sake (every choice had clear rationale)
