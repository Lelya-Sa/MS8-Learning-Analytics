## 🎯 **KEY DECISIONS MADE**

### **Architecture Decisions**
- ✅ **3-Stage Processing**: Collect → Analyze → Aggregate
- ✅ **3-Layer Storage**: Cache (24h) → Personal (7 days) → Aggregated (7 years)
- ✅ **Topic-Based Learning Paths**: Skills mapped to topics for mastery tracking
- ✅ **Role-Based Access**: Learner, Trainer, Organization HR/Management

### **Technology Decisions**
- ✅ **JavaScript**: No TypeScript conversion needed
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Vercel + Railway + Supabase (Pro tiers)
- ✅ **Authentication**: MS12 JWT + RBAC + Supabase RLS
- ✅ **AI Integration**: Google Gemini with 48h cache

### **Performance Decisions**
- ✅ **Enhanced Targets**: p50/p95/p99 < 40/100/250ms (cached)
- ✅ **Database**: p95 < 50ms, 0 queries > 1s
- ✅ **Cache Hit Rate**: > 90% with alerting
- ✅ **SWR Pattern**: Instant cached view + background refresh

### **Security Decisions**
- ✅ **Multi-Compliance**: GDPR + CCPA + FERPA + ISO 27001/SOC 2
- ✅ **Data Protection**: k-anonymity (k ≥ 10), audit logs 10 years
- ✅ **Privacy Controls**: Export, erasure, portability, consent management
- ✅ **Security Monitoring**: OWASP scans, security headers, CSP

### **Quality Decisions**
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 90%+ across branches/functions/lines/statements
- ✅ **TDD Approach**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- ✅ **Test Pyramid**: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: ESLint, testing, coverage, security scanning
