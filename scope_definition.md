## üöß **PROJECT CONSTRAINTS**

### **Timeline Constraints**
- **2-month deadline**: Aggressive but achievable with MVP scope
- **Solo development**: Requires careful prioritization
- **Integration priority**: All 9 microservices integration needed soon

### **Resource Constraints**
- **No team resources**: Maximum automation required
- **Solo maintenance**: Must be operationally simple
- **Low scale**: Can optimize for simplicity over scalability

### **Technical Constraints**
- **JavaScript only**: No TypeScript conversion
- **Existing infrastructure**: Must leverage Vercel, Railway, Supabase
- **Security compliance**: Multiple compliance frameworks required
