- All trainer cards (Teaching Effectiveness, Course Health, Student Distribution, Course Performance)

## Recommended Approach

Instead of creating a separate consolidated file that's missing 85% of the content, we should:

### Option 1: Consolidate Within Existing File (Recommended)
1. Add CSS custom properties at the top for shared values
2. Create shared class groups for identical card base styles (8+ cards share identical styles)
3. Create shared classes for common patterns (score sections, filter buttons, etc.)
4. Keep all card-specific content

**Benefits:**
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Reduces duplication without losing content
- Easier to maintain going forward
- Zero risk of breaking existing features

### Option 2: Keep Current Structure
- Current file works perfectly
- All features are styled correctly
- The duplication is not causing any issues (just file size)
- CSS minification during build will reduce file size anyway

## Current Status

✅ **Consolidated file created but incomplete** - 816 lines vs 6,962 lines  
❌ **Missing ~6,000 lines of critical styles**  
⚠️ **Not safe to replace original file**

## Recommendation

**Keep the current `analytics-cards.css` file as-is.** The file:
1. Works correctly with all features
2. Contains all necessary styles
3. Will be minified during production build
4. Has clear, organized sections (just duplicated)

The "consolidated" file is a proof of concept showing that we can reduce duplication using shared CSS classes, but it needs ALL sections added back in.

## Estimated Consolidation Potential

- **8 duplicate card base styles**: ~100 lines → ~20 lines (80% reduction)
- **Filter button patterns**: ~40 lines each in 3+ places → ~30 lines total (70% reduction)
- **Score section patterns**: ~30 lines each in 4+ places → ~40 lines total (66% reduction)
- **Chart container patterns**: ~30 lines each in 5+ places → ~40 lines total (73% reduction)

**Total potential savings**: ~200-300 lines from consolidating duplicates  
**Final file size**: ~6,600-6,700 lines (still includes all specific styles)

## Next Steps

1. **Option A**: Discard consolidated file, keep current working file
2. **Option B**: Add CSS variables to current file for easier maintenance
3. **Option C**: Manually consolidate duplicates within existing file (requires 2-3 hours)
