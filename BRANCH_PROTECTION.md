### Main Branch (master/main)
- **Require pull request reviews**: 1 reviewer minimum
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: Yes
- **Require status checks**: Yes
- **Required status checks**: 
  - frontend (CI/CD pipeline)
  - backend (CI/CD pipeline)
  - database (CI/CD pipeline)
  - security (CI/CD pipeline)
- **Require branches to be up to date**: Yes
- **Restrict pushes**: Yes (only via pull requests)
- **Allow force pushes**: No
- **Allow deletions**: No

### Development Branch (develop)
- **Require pull request reviews**: 1 reviewer minimum
- **Dismiss stale reviews**: Yes
- **Require status checks**: Yes
- **Required status checks**:

## üîß Implementation Steps

1. Go to GitHub repository Settings

4. Configure the settings as specified above
5. Save the branch protection rules

## üìã Additional Security Settings

- **Require signed commits**: Recommended for production
- **Require linear history**: Recommended for clean git history
- **Include administrators**: Yes (apply rules to admins too)
- **Allow specified actors to bypass**: No (unless necessary for CI/CD)

## üöÄ CI/CD Integration

The branch protection rules work in conjunction with the CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to ensure:
- All code changes go through automated testing
- Security checks are performed on every pull request
- Build artifacts are generated and validated
- Deployment status is tracked and reported

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- These settings should be configured in the GitHub repository settings
- Branch protection rules are essential for maintaining code quality
- The CI/CD pipeline must pass before any merge is allowed
- Consider adding additional security measures based on project requirements
