## 🏗️ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **3-Stage Processing Pipeline**
```
Stage 1: Collect → Stage 2: Analyze → Stage 3: Aggregate
```

### **3-Layer Storage Architecture**
```
Layer 1: Redis Cache (24h TTL) → Layer 2: Personal Analytics (7 days) → Layer 3: Aggregated Analytics (7 years)
```

### **Multi-Platform Deployment**
```
Frontend (Vercel) ↔ Backend (Railway) ↔ Database (Supabase)
```

### **Security Architecture**
```
JWT Authentication → RBAC Authorization → RLS Tenant Isolation → Audit Logging
```
